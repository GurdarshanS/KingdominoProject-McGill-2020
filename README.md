Introduction

In an elaborate fusion between the classic game of Domino and strategic territory building, Kingdomino is an easy to learn tile-laying game that allows players to explore various landscapes with a virtually limitless number of playing styles. In a game of expand and conquer, you are Lord who must grow his kingdom by strategically choosing between wheat fields, forests, lakes, mountains, swamps and plains.

Summary

In short, the goal of the game is for you, one of the Lords, to build your kingdom inside a 5x5 playing field and attempt to earn the highest possible number of crowns in doing so.

Setup:

There is a total of 48 dominoes available. Each and every single domino is associated to a unique number from 1 to 48.
The setup is simple but varies in accordance with the number of players. The main differences:
For 2-player games 
-	Each player will have two kings of the same color. 
-	There will only be 24 randomly selected dominoes each game.
-	The number of drafted dominoes per round is 4.
-	Each player will be placing his kings on two drafted dominoes per round.
-	There will be 6 rounds of drafts.
For 3-player games
-	Each player will have a single king of their desired color.
-	There will only be 36 randomly selected dominoes each game.
-	The number of drafted dominoes per round is 3.
-	Each player will be placing their king on a single drafted domino per round.
-	There will be 12 rounds of drafts.
For 4-player games
-	Each player will have a single king of their desired color.
-	All 48 available dominoes will be used.
-	The number of drafted dominoes per round is 4.
-	Each player will be placing their king on a single drafted domino per round.
-	There will be 12 rounds of drafts.

Once all the kings have been selected, the game starts. The players will notice their castle laying in the center of their respective kingdom playing field. This is their starting point for the territory.

The dominoes undergo thorough shuffling to allow for a completely random draft selection each round. This draw pile will be hidden from the field. Only the drafted dominoes will be revealed each round. These drafted dominoes are displayed on the side of the kingdom and are always placed in ascending order (lowest-valued domino to highest-valued domino depending on the number that has been associated to the specific piece.)

For the first draft of every game, the playing order is randomly selected. Each player will get a turn to place his king on a desired drafted and unchosen domino depending on the playing order. After the pieces have all been selected, a new draft will come out right beside the previous one.

The Game:

During the actual gameplay, the playing order is determined by the selection of the drafted dominoes’ order: the player who selected the top domino will move first, the player who selected the second domino from the top moves second, etc.

The following actions will be done for every turn during the game:
1.	The player will add their selected domino to the kingdom territory, always in accordance to the Connection Rules mentioned below.
2.	The player will then choose a new domino from the newest draft. Their king is placed on said domino to show that it has been selected. 
3.	After this, it is the next player does step 1 & 2.
4.	Step 3 is repeated until every single player has completed their two actions.

In a 2-player game, steps 1 & 2 are repeated twice, once for every king.

Connection Rules:

The player builds their kingdom in 5x5 grid, with the initial starting point being the castle in the middle of the kingdom. Each domino is composed of 2 squares.

To place a domino, the player must follow these guidelines:
-	Connect their domino to their starting piece, the castle. This piece is considered a wild card, meaning that literally any landscape can be connected to it.
-	Connect their domino to another domino that matches at least 1 of the landscapes on the piece. This can be done horizontally or vertically, however the two identical landscapes must always be in contact in order for it to be placed.

If a domino can’t be added to the kingdom by following these rules, it is discarded, and the player continues the game as if it was placed normally.

The game requires a certain level of strategic planning. All the dominoes should fit inside the 5x5 territory. If, due to a poor placement strategy, one or more of the dominoes cannot be placed inside this grid, it is also discarded, and the player continues the game as if it was placed normally.

End of The Game:

Once the players reach the last draft of cards, they will only perform action 1 from the list in The Game. By this point, the players will have completed their kingdom, this depending on the placement strategy of course. 

To calculate the total points for their kingdom, the player must follow these guidelines:
-	Each kingdom is composed of different groups of LANDSCAPES (wheat fields, lakes, mountains, etc.) that are connected together. The size of each LANDSCAPE is dependent on the number of connected pieces that form this group.
-	LANDSCAPES earn points only if they are connected to a piece of that same group who possesses a crown or multiple crowns on one of the domino’s tiles.
-	The number of crowns in this specific group is multiplied by the size of this LANDSCAPE.
-	LANDSCAPES of the same kind can earn points, as long as these separate groups have a piece with a crown.
-	LANDSCAPES with no crowns provide no points, no matter how large the LANDSCAPE.
-	Each player must add up the points from each different LANDSCAPE. The total score is the final score for the game.
The player with the highest final score wins the game.
In case of a tie, there exists tie-breaker rules:
The player with the most extended property will be the winner.
If it is still a tie, the player with the most crowns in total will be the winner.
If it is still a tie, both players are winners.

Bonus Rules

There are also other ways of earning points, but these must be agreed upon before the start of each game by all the players!

Dynasty: The players will play the game 3 times and keep score of their total crowns after each game. At the end of the 3 games, the player with the highest number of total crowns wins!
Harmony: Players with a perfect territory, meaning kingdoms who did not have to discard any dominoes, earn 5 additional points.
The Middle Kingdom: Players that have their initial piece, the castle, at the center of their kingdom at the end of the game earn 10 additional points.
The Mighty Duel: This rule only applies to 2-player games. Use all 48 available dominoes and use a 7x7 grid instead of a 5x5 one. All the other regular game rules are applied as usual.

Team Background:

Jay Han: U4 Mechanical, with a Software Eng. minor. Experience in Python and Machine Learning from leading the McGill Robotics Computer Vision subteam. Hoping to work on validating domino placement in the project. 

Eric Guan: U1 Computer Engineering. As I don't have much experience with coding, I hope to learn some new coding skills while working on the scoring system of the game in this project. As for personal interests, I enjoy playing basketball and video games.

Gurdarshan Johal: In Software Engineering, U1, I hope to make my task management better and work better in teams. I love food music and basketball.

Anthony Dagher: I’m a U1 Software Engineering student. Like others, I am still new to software development and coding in general, which is why I hope this team project will allow me to expand my knowledge in Java and Umple, as well as develop better teamworking skills. 

Keon Olszewski: I’m a first-year Software. Eng. student as well. I am trying to learn as much as I can with this project since it will be the first fully functional app that I will have built as a team. I’m interested in the UI design of this project. My passion is basketball.

Massimo Vadacchino: In software engineering, U1. I hope to improve my team communication skills and learn a variety of new software tools. I enjoy watching movies and sleeping.
